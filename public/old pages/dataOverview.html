The California Water Table
Groundwater level data for California.

# What is the level of the water table and how quickly does it change over time?




# Groundwater Basics
* Groundwater aquifers supply water in areas without streams and reservoirs, and is relied upon in time of drought.
* Groundwater is vital to the health and industry of our great state.
* Underground water exists mainly in gravelly deposits in the lowest valleys in the state.
* The water table is the top surface of water underground. 
* If you were to look in a well, the water table would be the level of the water and how far below the surface it is.
* The depth of the water table varies over time because of natural underground flows as well as human pumping and usage of groundwater for agriculture and household use.

# Like what we are doing? Support us!

We open up, innovate and demonstrate the relevance of important public
datasets and give them back to our storytellers and advocates
to enhance our ability to understand water in our state.

We are seeking support for our next project on water pricing
and for infrastructure and staff support for the NCWA.

# Feedback Questions 

# Disclaimer
We are re-publishing that information in an experimental format that can be more readily used by web programmers.
We make no assurances as to the accuracy of this data. We have described our methods of obtaining & transforming the data. We provide this data as a service to Californians who are interested in building maps and reporting on groundwater usage in the state. 

We have prepared data collected by the state and published through the CASGEM system into a format that works well with web-based visualization technologies so that citizens can more easily present visualizations telling important stories about the availability and health of our underground water. As our climate changes, we are developing our capacity to show what is happening with an invisible but vital resource. Unlike surface water, groundwater usage is not regulated in the state, so data is limited.



# FAQs

# Where the data comes from
The California Department of Water Resources maintains a system that collects and publishes groundwater research well data.
The data comes from scientific research wells, over 18,000 of them, which measure the levels of groundwater.


# How often is the data updated?

## How deep is the water table?
This varies. We do not have information for the total volume or recharge rates of the aquifers. We do have the estimated storage amounts for aquifers, and are looking into making land surface permeability and precipitation data available and integrated with this presentation of California groundwater.

It is actually quite expensive to drill wells deeper. What happens is that over time, groundwater fills back up from precipitation. Using too much water makes water unavailable, and requires that the water recharge. Intensive pumping, as happens in times of drought,

## Why is my well dry?
California has been in a drought. Agricultural and industrial use of water can deplete groundwater levels, effecting individual wells. We are interested to hear your stories of your dry wells, and to see if this map of groundwater can help to explain water availability and help advocate for fair usage of water in the state.

## I want to know if the water is clean.
We chose to provide the best data about the aquifers in the state and availability of water. A next step is to identify important water quality data and make it easier for story-tellers to use the data to present this information back to Californians. We have a list of datasets that are needed, and if you want to help make this go faster, please consider volunteering.
